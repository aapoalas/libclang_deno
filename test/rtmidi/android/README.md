# Example Android Studio project

Simple app using RtMidi. There are symlinks to 3 files in the main RtMidi
project

- RtMidi.cpp
- RdMidi.h
- MidiDeviceOpenedListener.java

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to build RtMidi into an
Android app. The app itself simply lists midi devices, opens the selected port
and prints out any incoming packet
