/**
 * Provides a shared context for creating translation units.
 *
 * It provides two options:
 *
 * - excludeDeclarationsFromPCH: When non-zero, allows enumeration of "local"
 * declarations (when loading any new translation units). A "local" declaration
 * is one that belongs in the translation unit itself and not in a precompiled
 * header that was used by the translation unit. If zero, all declarations
 * will be enumerated.
 *
 * Here is an example:
 *
 * ```cpp
 *   // excludeDeclsFromPCH = 1, displayDiagnostics=1
 *   Idx = clang_createIndex(1, 1);
 *   // IndexTest.pch was produced with the following command:
 *   // "clang -x c IndexTest.h -emit-ast -o IndexTest.pch"
 *   TU = clang_createTranslationUnit(Idx, "IndexTest.pch");
 *   // This will load all the symbols from 'IndexTest.pch'
 *   clang_visitChildren(clang_getTranslationUnitCursor(TU),
 *                       TranslationUnitVisitor, 0);
 *   clang_disposeTranslationUnit(TU);
 *   // This will load all the symbols from 'IndexTest.c', excluding symbols
 *   // from 'IndexTest.pch'.
 *   char *args[] = { "-Xclang", "-include-pch=IndexTest.pch" };
 *   TU = clang_createTranslationUnitFromSourceFile(Idx, "IndexTest.c", 2, args,
 *                                                  0, 0);
 *   clang_visitChildren(clang_getTranslationUnitCursor(TU),
 *                       TranslationUnitVisitor, 0);
 *   clang_disposeTranslationUnit(TU);
 * ```
 * This process of creating the 'pch', loading it separately, and using it (via
 * -include-pch) allows 'excludeDeclsFromPCH' to remove redundant callbacks
 * (which gives the indexer the same performance benefit as the compiler).

 * corresponding method in the interface.
 *
 * For C++, a virtual member function overrides any virtual member
 * function with the same signature that occurs in its base
 * classes. With multiple inheritance, a virtual member function can
 * override several virtual member functions coming from different
 * base classes.

 * method, rather than all of the overridden methods. For example, if

 * invoked on C's method will be B's method. The client may then

 * methods, to map out the complete method-override set.

 *
 * Code completion itself is meant to be triggered by the client when the
 * user types punctuation characters or whitespace, at which point the
 * code-completion location will coincide with the cursor. For example, if `p` is a pointer, code-completion might be triggered after the "-" and then
 * after the ">" in `p->.` When the code-completion location is after the ">",
 * the completion results will provide, e.g., the members of the struct that
 * "p" points to. The client is responsible for placing the cursor at the
 * beginning of the token currently being typed, then filtering the results
 * based on the contents of the token. For example, when code-completing for
 * the expression `p->get,` the client should provide the location just after
 * the ">" (e.g., pointing at the "g") to this code-completion hook. Then, the
 * client can filter the results based on the current token text ("get"), only
 * showing those results that start with "get". The intent of this interface
 * is to separate the relatively high-latency acquisition of code-completion
 * results from the filtering of results on a per-character basis, which must
 * have a lower latency.
 *
 * @param TU The translation unit in which code-completion should
 * occur. The source files for this translation unit need not be
 * completely up-to-date (and the contents of those source files may
 * be overridden via `unsaved_files).` Cursors referring into the
 * translation unit may be invalidated by this invocation.
 * @param complete_filename The name of the source file where code
 * completion should be performed. This filename may be any file
 * included in the translation unit.
 * @param complete_line The line at which code-completion should occur.
 * @param complete_column The column at which code-completion should occur.
 * Note that the column should point just after the syntactic construct that
 * initiated code completion, and not in the middle of a lexical token.
 * @param unsaved_files the Files that have not yet been saved to disk
 * but may be required for parsing or code completion, including the
 * contents of those files.  The contents and name of these files (as
 * specified by CXUnsavedFile) are copied when necessary, so the
 * client only needs to guarantee their validity until the call to
 * this function returns.
 * @param num_unsaved_files The number of unsaved file entries in `unsaved_files.`
 * @param options Extra options that control the behavior of code
 * completion, expressed as a bitwise OR of the enumerators of the
 * CXCodeComplete_Flags enumeration. The
 * `clang_defaultCodeCompleteOptions(`) function returns a default set
 * of code-completion options.
 * @returns If successful, a new `CXCodeCompleteResults` structure
 * containing code-completion results, which should eventually be
 * freed with `clang_disposeCodeCompleteResults().` If code
 * completion fails, returns NULL.
